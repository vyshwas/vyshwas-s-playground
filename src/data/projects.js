    context:
      'Late-night checkout flows for food delivery often suffer from high cart abandonment due to last-minute fees and payment anxiety.',
    problem:
      'When a payment fails or extra fees are added at the very end, generic red error messages and sudden price jumps destroy trust. Users feel cheated, resulting in high abandonment at the highest-friction step of the funnel.',
    approach:
      'I designed a checkout experience optimized to preserve trust. The UI actively absorbs blame for failures with empathetic error states, proactively explains late-night surges ("Night owl fee waived"), and highlights UPI-first payment methods with clear, contextual trust cues right above the CTA.',

    problem:
      'Current delegation relies on sharing OTPs, physical cards, or screenshots. These workarounds are highly insecure, unscalable, and lack accountability, forcing users to choose between convenience and security.',
    approach:
      'Munim introduces a "supervised delegation" model inspired by the traditional \'bahi-khata\' (ledger). It features a robust mandate system, supervised payment requests via a secure UPI PIN sheet, and a live countdown hold mechanism for high-risk transactions.',
